After the horseless carriage
============================

Being a disciple of [Bill Hill](www.billhillsite.com/osprey.doc), I'm loathe to venture very far from the paged book, but I want more in an electronic-book format than PDF, ePub or web-pages in general provide.

And, chiefly, I want an electronic book to take advantage of its being read on a device with a CPU (without being overwhelmed by that electronicity).

Most books that I personally consume suffer not at all by being delivered as PDFs or ePubs. In part that's because I'm conditioned to want my information in serial paged form, with color and artwork.

If I depended on graphic novels, if I liked the idea of videos embedded in a suspense thriller, if I wanted to choose different narrative paths in a book with multiple endings, I'd be unhappy. (But I don't, and so I'm not unhappy, at least in those respects.)

PDF and ePub, while allowing us electronic distribution and instant dictionary lookup and immediate linking to content outside the book, behave like print books in the way that the first horseless carriages behaved like carriages, just with, well, horseless propulsion.

And I'm ready for more.
